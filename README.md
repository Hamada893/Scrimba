## üöÅ Learn HTML & CSS (Dec 2025): 

Started on the 20th of December, this course was taken to brush up on the fundamentals of HTML and CSS, serving as a strong foundation for more advanced learning. By revisiting essential concepts, the goal was to ensure a solid grasp of these core web technologies, paving the way for a smoother transition into the Learn JavaScript course. This journey represents an important step toward mastering front-end development and eventually learning React, which will enable the creation of dynamic, modern web interfaces. While the primary focus is on web development, there is also a possibility of branching into app development in the future.
