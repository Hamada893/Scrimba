# The World's Most Annoying Cookie Consent 🍪

## About
"The World's Most Annoying Cookie Consent" is a fun yet frustrating project that takes user consent to a whole new level! This project plays with various JavaScript concepts to create an overly persistent and interactive cookie consent modal.

## What I Learned 🧠
While building this project, I explored several key JavaScript concepts:

- **setTimeout** ⏳ – Used to introduce delays for better control over animations and user interactions.
- **Forms** 📝 – Implemented form handling to capture user input.
- **Manipulating Form Data with `.get()`** 🔍 – Extracted specific values from form submissions.
- **Toggling Classes** 🎭 – Dynamically added and removed CSS classes to change element behavior and styling.
- **Preventing Default Browser Behavior (`.preventDefault()`)** ❌ – Stopped default form submission behavior for custom handling.
- **`element.style`** 🎨 – Directly modified inline styles of elements via JavaScript.
- **`.disabled` Attribute** 🚫 – Enabled and disabled buttons based on user interactions.

## Features 🎭
- Persistent cookie consent modal that refuses to go away easily.
- Fake loading animations to "upload user data" (just for fun!).
- Interactive form handling with custom logic.
- A final "thank you" message that makes users regret clicking "accept."

## How to Use 🛠️
1. Open the project in a browser.
2. Try to dismiss the cookie consent – good luck! 😈
3. Fill out the form and experience the most annoying consent process ever.
4. Watch as the modal refuses to cooperate.


## Installation & Setup 🏗️
Simply clone the repository and open `index.html` in your browser:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/yourusername/annoying-cookie-consent.git
$ cd annoying-cookie-consent
$ open index.html

Enjoy! (Or suffer.) 😜
