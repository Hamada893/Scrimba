# Responsive Layout (CSS Grid)

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of **CSS Grid** to create a fully responsive layout. The layout adapts to different screen sizes using media queries and various grid properties. The goal of this project is to deepen my understanding of CSS Grid and how it can be utilized for modern web design.

## Concepts Learned & Used
During this project, I explored and implemented the following **CSS Grid** concepts:

- **grid-template-columns**: Defines the columns in a grid layout.
- **grid-template-rows**: Defines the rows in a grid layout.
- **span**: Allows grid items to span multiple columns or rows.
- **grid-column**: Specifies the start and end position of a grid item along columns.
- **grid-row**: Specifies the start and end position of a grid item along rows.
- **grid-lines**: Used to place grid items relative to specific numbered lines.
- **grid-template-areas**: Assigns names to specific grid sections for easier layout control.
- **grid-auto-rows**: Specifies the height of automatically created rows.
- **auto-fit**: Adjusts grid items to fit available space dynamically.
- **grid-auto-flow**: Controls the direction in which items are placed in the grid.
- **dense**: Allows the grid to fill empty spaces with smaller items if possible.
- **repeat()**: A shorthand function to define repeated columns or rows.
- **minmax()**: Defines a flexible size range for grid items.
- **fr unit**: A fractional unit for dividing available space proportionally.
- **gap**: Defines spacing between grid rows and columns.


## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/responsive-layout.git
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in a browser to see the responsive layout in action.
3. Modify `styles.css` to experiment with different grid properties.
