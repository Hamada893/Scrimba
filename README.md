# üìÉ About This Repository:

Welcome to the foundational projects repository for Scrimba! This repository serves as a collection of all the hands-on projects completed during various Scrimba courses, providing a comprehensive showcase of the skills and knowledge gained throughout the learning journey. Each project is neatly organized into its own folder, with the folder name reflecting the specific course it was derived from. Whether you're revisiting completed projects, exploring new courses, or seeking inspiration for your own coding journey, this repository aims to be a well-structured and easily navigable resource for all things Scrimba-related.

## üöÅ Learn HTML & CSS (Dec 2025) (‚úÖ Completed): 

Started on the 20th of December, this course was taken to brush up on the fundamentals of HTML and CSS, serving as a strong foundation for more advanced learning. By revisiting essential concepts, the goal was to ensure a solid grasp of these core web technologies, paving the way for a smoother transition into the Learn JavaScript course. This journey represents an important step toward mastering front-end development and eventually learning React, which will enable the creation of dynamic, modern web interfaces. While the primary focus is on web development, there is also a possibility of branching into app development in the future.

## üß† Learn JavaScript (üîÉ In Progress):

Started on the 24th of December, this course introduces fundamental programming concepts like conditionals, loops, methods, and object-oriented programming (OOP). This course is an exciting step in learning JavaScript, focusing on problem-solving, bug fixing, and foundational techniques for building dynamic applications. Progress includes completing several interactive projects, such as a password generator, Blackjack game, and randomized emoji picker. These projects not only solidify understanding of core JavaScript concepts but also emphasize practical application, helping to build confidence in coding independently. As the journey unfolds, this course aims to lay the groundwork for becoming proficient in JavaScript, with the ultimate goal of transitioning to more advanced frameworks like React and beyond. üöÄ
