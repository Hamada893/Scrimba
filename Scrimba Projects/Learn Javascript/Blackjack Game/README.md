# â™  JavaScript Blackjack Game 

This is a simple Blackjack game implemented in JavaScript, created as part of the "Learn JavaScript" course on Scrimba. The game introduces various foundational concepts in JavaScript such as methods, object-oriented programming (OOP), conditionals, number randomization, and proper bug fixing.

## Features

- **Blackjack Game Logic**: The player is dealt cards and must try to get as close to 21 as possible without going over.
- **Player Object**: The player's information (name and chips) is encapsulated in an object to demonstrate basic OOP principles.
- **Card Randomization**: The cards are drawn randomly, and the deck is simulated to ensure a unique experience every time.
- **Game Flow**: The game has checks for whether the player has won, lost, or has a blackjack, with dynamic updates to the player's chip count.
- **Bug Fixing**: The game was developed with a focus on debugging, ensuring a smooth and bug-free user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** for structuring the page.
- **CSS** for styling the game interface.
- **JavaScript** for game logic, event handling, and dynamic updates.

## How to Play

1. Start the game by clicking the "Start Game" button.
2. The player will be dealt two cards.
3. The player can choose to **"draw new card"** or **"Stay"** (end the turn).
4. The goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it.
5. If the player's hand exceeds 21, they lose.
6. If the player gets 21 with the first two cards, they win with a **Blackjack**.
7. The player's chip count is updated after each round.
