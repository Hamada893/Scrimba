# 📚 Unit Converter

Welcome to the **Unit Converter** project! ✨ This project is a simple, interactive tool for converting between metric and imperial units of **length**, **volume**, and **mass**. The app dynamically updates conversion results based on user input and uses foundational JavaScript concepts to power its functionality.

---

## Features

✅ **Dynamic Unit Conversion**: Convert between meters/feet, liters/gallons, and kilograms/pounds seamlessly.  
✅ **User Input Handling**: Accepts numeric input from the user and updates results dynamically.  
✅ **Responsive Design**: Clean and simple user interface styled using CSS.  
✅ **Keyboard Support**: Press "Enter" to trigger conversions for a faster experience.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structuring the layout of the page.  
- **CSS**: Styling the containers and creating an appealing design.  
- **JavaScript**: Handling the logic and interactivity of the application.

## Foundational JavaScript Concepts Introduced

This project serves as a great introduction to core JavaScript concepts:

### 1. **DOM Manipulation** ✨
   - Using `document.querySelector()` to select HTML elements.
   - Dynamically updating content using `textContent`.

### 2. **Event Handling** ⏳
   - Adding click events with `addEventListener()` to handle button clicks.
   - Detecting key presses (e.g., Enter) with the `keyup` event.

### 3. **Functions** ⚙️
   - Writing reusable functions for converting units like `convertLength()`, `convertVolume()`, and `convertMass()`.
   - A helper function `round()` to ensure results are rounded to three decimal places.

### 4. **Math Operations** ➕
   - Using multiplication and division to calculate conversions.
   - Leveraging `Math.round()` for precise rounding.

### 5. **Type Coercion & Default Values** 🌄
   - Converting user input into numbers with `Number()`.
   - Using the OR (`||`) operator to handle empty inputs and set default values.

## How It Works 🚀

1. Enter a number in the input box.
2. Click the "Convert" button or press "Enter".
3. The app instantly calculates and displays the equivalent values for length, volume, and mass in both metric and imperial units.

## Code Overview 📝

### Conversion Rates:
- 1 meter = 3.281 feet
- 1 liter = 0.264 gallon
- 1 kilogram = 2.204 pound

### Key JavaScript Functions:
- `convertLength(value)`: Converts between meters and feet.
- `convertVolume(value)`: Converts between liters and gallons.
- `convertMass(value)`: Converts between kilograms and pounds.
- `updateConversions()`: Fetches user input, performs conversions, and updates the DOM.

## Example Output 🎨

If you enter `20` in the input box, the output will be:

- **Length**: 20 meters = 65.616 feet | 20 feet = 6.096 meters  
- **Volume**: 20 liters = 5.284 gallons | 20 gallons = 75.706 liters  
- **Mass**: 20 kilos = 44.092 pounds | 20 pounds = 9.072 kilos
